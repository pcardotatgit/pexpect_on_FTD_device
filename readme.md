## Introduction

This code is an example of pexpect code for SSH interaction with a FirePOWER sensor.

The number of use case are infinite.

- from collecting device telemetry ( Checking VPN Remote Access load on every devices )
- To debugging and troubleshooting

Every an administrator can do thru SSH admin access can be done thanks to pexpect exactly the same way

**Why pexpect and Not Netmiko ?**  :  Just because netmiko doesn't support FTD devices yet.

But netmiko is perfect for interacting with a Cisco ASA or any other Legacy Cisco Networking devices. It is more easy to use than pexpect.
